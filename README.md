### Purpose

### Summary
Pomodory is a Pomodoro timer implemented as a full-stack web application built with React and Flask. Features include user creation, a timer, a fish, and a todo list saved for each user. Once a user has signed in or created their account, they can use the timer to their liking.

Both the frontend and the backend are hosted on AWS. Deployments are automated using GitHub Actions.
